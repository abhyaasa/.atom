Vāsudeva-parā vedā Vāsudeva-parā makhāḥ
Vāsudeva-parā yogā Vāsudeva-parāḥ kriyāḥ
 
Vāsudeva-paraṁ jñānaṁ Vāsudeva-paraṁ tapaḥ
Vāsudeva-paro dharmo Vāsudeva-parā gatiḥ
 

Vedas preach Vāsudeva as the ultimate supreme goal to be attained. Vāsudeva is the essence of the entire knowledge of Vedas and He is the ultimate object of Vedas. All Yagnas (sacrificial rituals) performed are solely for Vāsudeva. All actions are ultimately offered/ surrendered into Him. He is the ultimate goal of all Yoga. All actions ultimately end in Him. Vāsudeva alone will be obtained through attaining knowledge (jnāna). All austerities (tapas) and adherence to righteousness (dharma) are undertaken for Vāsudeva alone. The fruits of all actions including attaining heaven ultimately merge into Vāsudeva.

Vāsudeva here refers to the Supreme Godhead, Paramatma. Everything attains fulfillment only when it merges into Paramatma. This is the implied meaning of this verse.
